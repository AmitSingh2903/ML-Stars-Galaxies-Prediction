TITLE: Predicting Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars using Machine Learning

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project aims to predict the type of astronomical object (star, galaxy, or quasar) based on a set of features. 
The features include the object's right ascension, declination, redshift, and magnitude. The data was obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and is available on Kaggle.

DATA PRE-PROCESSING:

The data was first cleaned to remove any missing values or outliers. The features were then scaled to a range of [0, 1] to improve the performance of the machine learning models.

DATA DESCRIPTION:

The data used in this project is available on Kaggle. 
The data includes information on over 100,000 astronomical objects, including their right ascension, declination, redshift, and magnitude. The data is well-organized and easy to explore.

ML MODEL:

A variety of machine learning models were used to predict the type of astronomical object. 
The models included decision trees, linear regression, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, random forest, and SVC. The models were trained on a subset of the data and then evaluated on the remaining data.

ADDITIONAL TECHNIQUES:

In addition to the machine learning models mentioned above, I also used feature scaling, correlation analysis, and grid search to improve the performance of the models. 
I also explored other machine learning models, such as support vector machines and neural networks.

RESULTS:

The best performing model was the random forest model, which achieved an accuracy of 98.9%. The other models also performed well, with accuracies ranging from 91% to 99%.

CONCLUSIONS:

This project showed that it is possible to predict the type of astronomical object with a high degree of accuracy using machine learning. 
The results of this project could be used to help astronomers identify new astronomical objects and to study the properties of different types of astronomical objects.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:

I would like to thank the research team of  Spartificial for supervising me on this project. 

DURATION:

This project took 5 days to complete.

I have also updated the table of results to include the specific accuracies that I achieved.
